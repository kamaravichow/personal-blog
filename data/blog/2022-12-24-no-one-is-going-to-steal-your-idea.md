I recently noticed in my friend group a few of my friends are scared to build a product they have in mind because they're scared that it will be stolen.

In my opinion, **Ideas don't count** Not only is your idea almost certainly not original but it's probably a bad idea too. But that is fine - all ideas are bad ideas.

That precious little idea that you're so fond of is just a starting point, and it's almost always a starting point that doesn't work.

I think it's important to remember that an idea is just the beginning. It takes a lot of hard work and effort to turn an idea into a successful business. Even if someone were to steal your idea, they would still need to put in the time and effort to make it a reality.

Finally, it's important to remember that ideas are often not as unique as we might think. It's likely that other people have had similar ideas to yours, and it's the execution and execution of an idea that sets it apart. By focusing on execution and building a strong foundation for your business, you can increase the chances of success and reduce the risk of having your ideas stolen.
